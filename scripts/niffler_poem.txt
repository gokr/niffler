Oh Niffler, with your snout so keen,
In pockets deep, you love to glean.
With fur of black and eyes so bright,
You shimmer in the moonlit night.

A creature small, but swift and sly,
You burrow deep where treasures lie.
With tiny paws and nose that twitch,
You make the strangest pockets itch.

Though mischief calls and coins allure,
Your heart is pure, your spirit sure.
A friend to those who love and trust,
Oh Niffler, you're not just a crust.

In gardens dark and cellars deep,
You gather gold while others sleep.
But bring you close and keep you near,
For Nifflers love those they hold dear.
