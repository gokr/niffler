## Mode Type Definitions
##
## This module defines the operation mode types for Niffler's agentic behavior.
## Inspired by Claude Code's Plan/Code workflow.
##
## Mode Types:
## - Plan: Analysis, research, planning, and todo generation
## - Code: Implementation, execution, and completing todos
##
## Design Philosophy:
## - Simple two-mode system (avoid complexity of multi-mode systems)
## - Mode switching via Shift+Tab for seamless workflow
## - Both modes have access to all tools (no artificial restrictions)
## - Mode affects system prompts and behavior, not capabilities

  ## Get the next mode for toggling (Plan â†” Code)
  case mode:
