# Niffler Thinking Token Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of thinking token support in Niffler, explaining how the system enables AI models to show their reasoning process and enhance problem-solving capabilities.

## Overview

Thinking tokens represent a breakthrough in AI transparency, allowing models to expose their internal reasoning process. Niffler provides complete support for thinking tokens across multiple AI providers, enabling users to see how models arrive at their conclusions and benefit from more deliberate, self-correcting responses.

## Core Infrastructure

Niffler's thinking token system is built on a robust multi-threaded architecture with dedicated components for parsing, management, and visualization:

**Thinking Token IR Types**: Multi-provider intermediate representation that normalizes different thinking token formats into a unified internal structure.

**Message Type Extensions**: Extended message types that support reasoning content alongside regular responses, enabling seamless integration with existing conversation flows.

**Configuration Schema**: Flexible thinking token configuration supporting different budget levels (low/medium/high) with customizable token limits.

**Multi-Provider Parser**: Intelligent parsing system supporting Anthropic XML format, OpenAI JSON format, and encrypted content detection.

**Streaming Integration**: Real-time processing during response generation, allowing users to see reasoning as it develops.

**CLI Visualization**: Terminal display system with distinct formatting for reasoning content versus regular responses.

**Budget Management**: Token budget system with configurable limits to control reasoning verbosity and costs.

**Context-Aware Windowing**: Intelligent preservation of important reasoning content when approaching budget limits.

## Architecture Overview

### Key Components

#### 1. Type System (`src/types/thinking_tokens.nim`)
```nim
ThinkingContent* = object
  reasoningContent*: Option[string]      # Plain text reasoning
  encryptedReasoningContent*: Option[string]  # Encrypted reasoning for privacy models
  reasoningId*: Option[string]           # Unique ID for reasoning correlation
  providerSpecific*: Option[JsonNode]    # Provider-specific metadata
```

#### 2. Streaming Parser (`src/api/thinking_token_parser.nim`)
- Multi-provider format detection and parsing
- Incremental parsing for real-time streaming
- Automatic format identification

#### 3. Budget Management (`src/types/thinking_tokens.nim`)
- Configurable token budgets (2048/4096/8192 tokens)
- Real-time token usage tracking
- Automatic enforcement of limits

#### 4. Context Windowing (`src/types/thinking_tokens.nim`)
- Importance-based token preservation
- Automatic cleanup of low-priority content
- Configurable window sizes

## Features and Capabilities

### Multi-Provider Support
Niffler supports thinking tokens across different AI providers:
- **Anthropic**: XML `<thinking>` block format parsing
- **OpenAI**: Native `reasoning_content` field handling  
- **Encrypted Models**: Support for `encrypted_reasoning` and `redacted_thinking` content

### Real-Time Processing
The system processes thinking tokens in real-time during response generation:
- Streaming thinking token extraction as responses develop
- Separate callbacks for reasoning versus regular content
- Automatic content separation and classification

### Intelligent Management
Advanced management features ensure optimal thinking token usage:
- **Budget System**: Configurable token limits per reasoning level to control costs
- **Context-Aware Windowing**: Preservation of important reasoning when approaching limits
- **Importance Classification**: Automatic detection and prioritization of critical reasoning content

## Benefits of Thinking Tokens

### Enhanced Problem Solving
- **Self-Correction**: Models can catch and fix their own reasoning errors
- **Transparency**: Users see exactly how conclusions are reached
- **Multi-Turn Intelligence**: Preserved reasoning across conversation turns

### Next-Gen Model Support
- **GPT-5 Ready**: Full support for advanced reasoning capabilities
- **Claude 4 Compatible**: Native handling of Anthropic thinking blocks
- **Privacy Models**: Encrypted reasoning content support

### Efficiency Improvements
- **Better First Responses**: Reduced trial-and-error through reasoning
- **Cost Optimization**: More deliberate API usage with upfront analysis
- **Error Reduction**: Systematic approach to problem-solving reduces mistakes

## Configuration Options

### Model-Level Settings
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "nickname": "advanced",
      "reasoning": "high",        // Enable high-level reasoning (8192 tokens)
      "reasoningContent": "visible"  // Show reasoning content to user
    }
  ],
  "thinkingTokensEnabled": true,    // Global enable/disable
  "defaultReasoningLevel": "medium" // Default budget level
}
```

### Runtime Controls
- **Budget Levels**: low (2048), medium (4096), high (8192) token limits
- **Content Visibility**: visible/hidden/encrypted reasoning display
- **Window Management**: Automatic context preservation settings

## Testing and Validation

The thinking token system includes comprehensive testing to ensure reliability across all supported providers and edge cases:

**Core Functionality Tests**: Validation of Anthropic XML parsing, OpenAI JSON handling, multi-provider format detection, and incremental streaming parsing.

**Budget and Management Tests**: Verification of token counting accuracy, budget enforcement, and context windowing behavior.

**Edge Case Handling**: Robust handling of malformed content, empty reasoning blocks, case sensitivity variations, and provider-specific quirks.

**Helper Function Validation**: Testing of utility functions for streaming chunk extraction and content classification.

## API Integration Points

### Message Types
Extended `Message` and `StreamChunk` types with:
- `thinkingContent`: Optional[ThinkingContent]
- `isThinkingContent`: bool
- `isEncrypted`: Option[bool]

### Streaming Callbacks
Modified streaming infrastructure to handle:
- Separate reasoning content callbacks
- Real-time thinking token extraction
- Automatic content classification

### Database Schema
Conversation manager extensions for:
- Thinking token storage and retrieval
- Importance-based indexing
- Cross-conversation reasoning linking

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Lightweight token objects with minimal overhead
- Efficient windowing system with automatic cleanup
- Streaming-first design avoids large memory allocations

### Processing Overhead
- Minimal impact on non-thinking models
- Asynchronous processing for real-time streaming
- Smart buffering to balance performance and responsiveness

## Security Features
