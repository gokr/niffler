# Niffler Project Status & Roadmap

*Consolidated status and todo document - Last updated: August 2025*

## Project Overview

Niffler is an AI-powered terminal assistant written in Nim, designed to replicate and enhance the functionality of the original Octofriend (TypeScript). This document tracks our progress in achieving feature parity and beyond.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ **Phase 1-3: Foundation (COMPLETED)**
- Multi-threaded architecture with dedicated workers
- OpenAI-compatible HTTP client with SSL support
- Configuration management (TOML-based)
- Basic CLI interface with commands (`/help`, `/models`, `/clear`)
- Message history tracking
- Environment variable support
- Debug logging control

### ✅ **Phase 4: Tool System (COMPLETED)**

**Core Tool Infrastructure:**
- Exception-based error handling with custom types
- Tool registry and discovery system  
- Dedicated tool worker thread
- Thread-safe channel communication
- JSON schema validation framework

**Implemented Tools (6/6):**
- **bash** - Command execution with timeout/process management
- **read** - File reading with encoding detection and size limits
- **list** - Directory listing with filtering and metadata
- **edit** - Diff-based editing with backup system
- **create** - File creation with safety checks
- **fetch** - HTTP/HTTPS content fetching with scraping

## Gap Analysis: Niffler vs Octofriend

### **Major Missing Features**

#### **LLM Integration (High Priority)**
- ❌ **Real-time Streaming** - SSE parsing and typewriter effects
- ❌ **Tool Calling** - JSON schema validation and execution  
- ❌ **Multiple Providers** - Anthropic, OpenAI, custom endpoints

- ❌ **Streaming Display** - Real-time response rendering
- ❌ **Diff Visualization** - Colored diff rendering with syntax highlighting
- ❌ **Menu System** - ESC-triggered navigation and settings
- ❌ **Status Bar** - Model, mode, token count, time indicators

#### **Auto-fix System (Octofriend's Key Differentiator)**
- ❌ **Diff Apply** - ML models for fixing edit mistakes
- ❌ **JSON Fix** - Malformed JSON correction
- ❌ **Error Recovery** - Automatic retry with smart fixes

#### **Advanced Features**
- ❌ **MCP Integration** - Model Context Protocol for external tools
- ❌ **File Tracking** - Change detection and safe editing
- ❌ **Session Management** - Save/restore conversations
- ❌ **Reasoning Effort** - Low/medium/high reasoning control
- ❌ **Tool Confirmation** - Interactive user confirmations

### **Minor Missing Features**

- [ ] Context-aware error analysis
- [ ] Automatic prompt refinement
- [ ] Progressive fallback strategies

### **Phase 8: File Management & Safety (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### 8.1: File Tracking
- [ ] Timestamp-based change detection
- [ ] Safe editing prevention for modified files
- [ ] File locking for multi-process safety
- [ ] Automatic backup system

#### 8.2: Tool Confirmation System
- [ ] Interactive user confirmations for dangerous operations
- [ ] Confirmation UI integration
- [ ] Bypass options for trusted operations

### **Phase 9: MCP Integration (LOWER PRIORITY)**

#### 9.1: MCP Client
- [ ] Server connection and communication
- [ ] Dynamic tool loading from servers
- [ ] Resource access management
- [ ] Caching system for performance

#### 9.2: External Tools
- [ ] Integration with external services
- [ ] Service discovery
- [ ] Protocol versioning support
- [ ] Security model for external tools

## Technical Implementation Notes

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **Threading**: Maintain current thread-based approach vs async
- **Error Handling**: Continue exception-based approach where appropriate
- **Terminal UI**: Evaluate illwill library vs custom React/Ink equivalent
- **HTTP Streaming**: Implement SSE without async/await pattern

### **Nim-Specific Challenges**
- **Terminal UI Library**: Need React/Ink equivalent functionality
- **JSON Schema**: Runtime validation without TypeScript structural types
- **HTTP Streaming**: SSE parsing in threaded environment
- **Memory Management**: Leverage Nim's deterministic memory management

### **Quality Gates**
- All features must compile with `--threads:on -d:ssl`
- Comprehensive error handling for API interactions
- Thread-safe operations throughout
- Performance equal to or better than TypeScript version

## Success Metrics

### **Phase Completion Criteria**
- **Phase 5**: Streaming responses and tool calling functional
- **Phase 6**: Rich terminal interface with menu navigation  
- **Phase 7**: Basic auto-fix system working
- **Phase 8**: Safe file operations with change detection

### **Feature Parity Goal**
Target: 80%+ of Octofriend's core functionality working in Niffler by end of Phase 6.

**Current Progress: ~40%**
- ✅ Foundation: 100%
- ✅ Tool System: 85% (missing confirmations, MCP)
- ❌ LLM Integration: 20% (basic HTTP only)
- ❌ Terminal UI: 5% (basic CLI only)
- ❌ Auto-fix: 0%
- ❌ File Management: 30% (basic file ops only)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Start Phase 5.1**: Implement SSE streaming infrastructure
2. **Tool Calling**: Add JSON schema validation and tool execution
3. **Provider Support**: Add Anthropic API client
4. **Basic UI Enhancements**: Add colored output and progress indicators
