# Markdown and Diff Rendering in Niffler

## Current Enhanced UI Implementation

**âœ… Already has basic markdown rendering** in `src/ui/enhanced.nim:178-280`:

- **Headers**: H1 (`#`), H2 (`##`), H3 (`###`) with different colors and symbols
- **Inline formatting**: Bold (`**text**`), italic (`*text*`), inline code (`` `code` ``)
- **Links**: `[text](url)` display (shows text part only)
- **Lists**: Bullet lists (`-`, `*`) and numbered lists
- **Code blocks**: ``` delimiter detection

The implementation uses `illwill` for terminal control with ANSI colors and styling.

## Recommended Nim Libraries for Enhancement

### Markdown Parsing Libraries

1. **`nim-markdown`** - Most mature option
   - CommonMark and GFM support
   - Extension system for custom features
   - Installation: `nimble install markdown`

2. **`nmark`** - Performance-focused
   - ~4x faster than nim-markdown
   - CommonMark-based but not fully spec-compliant yet

### Diff Rendering Libraries

1. **`hldiff`** - Perfect for git-style diffs
   - Ports Python's difflib with ~100x performance improvement
   - Colored terminal output with customizable ANSI/SGR escapes
   - Git diff compatibility: `git diff | hldiff`
   - Installation: `nimble install hldiff`

2. **Built-in `std/terminal`** - Basic colored output
   - Already used in Niffler's current implementation
   - Provides foreground/background colors and text styles

## Current Status Summary

**âœ… What's already implemented:**
- Basic markdown rendering with illwill
- Colored terminal output
- Text styling (bold, italic, code, headers, lists)

**ðŸ”§ Potential improvements:**
- Replace basic regex-based markdown with `nim-markdown` for better spec compliance
- Add `hldiff` for proper diff rendering in tool outputs
- Enhanced syntax highlighting for code blocks

## Implementation Details

The enhanced UI in `src/ui/enhanced.nim` includes:

- `renderInlineMarkdown()` - Handles bold, italic, code, links
- `renderMarkdownLine()` - Handles headers, lists, code blocks
- `updateResponseArea()` - Main display logic with markdown rendering
- Color scheme using illwill's color constants (fgYellow, fgGreen, fgCyan, etc.)

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for markdown rendering in terminal applications, with room for enhancement using dedicated parsing libraries.
